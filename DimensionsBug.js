This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions.  The `Dimensions.get('window')` method might return incorrect values, particularly on Android, especially in certain cases like immediately after the app starts, during screen rotation, or after returning from a background state.  This leads to layout issues where components are positioned or sized incorrectly.
